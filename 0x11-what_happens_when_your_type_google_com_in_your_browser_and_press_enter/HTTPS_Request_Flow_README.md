# HTTPS Request Flow: From Browser to Webpage

This README describes the detailed flow that happens when a user enters "https://www.google.com" into their web browser and presses Enter. The process involves several steps, including DNS resolution, encrypted communication, firewall checks, load balancing, web and application server interaction, and database queries.

## Process Overview

1. **DNS Resolution**:
    - When you type "https://www.google.com" and press Enter, your browser first sends a request to the DNS server to translate the domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address.

2. **Firewall**:
    - The resolved IP address and traffic flow are then processed through a **firewall**. This firewall checks if the outgoing and incoming traffic is safe and permitted.

3. **Encrypted Traffic (HTTPS)**:
    - After the firewall check, the browser and server establish a secure connection using **TLS/SSL** encryption (HTTPS). This ensures that the communication between your browser and Google’s servers is secure.

4. **Load Balancer**:
    - Once the secure connection is established, the request is passed through a **load balancer**. The load balancer distributes the traffic to one of Google's many web servers to handle the request. This is done to optimize performance and reliability.

5. **Web Server**:
    - The request reaches one of Google’s **web servers** at the IP address obtained from the DNS resolution. The web server listens on port **443** (HTTPS) and processes the request.

6. **Application Server**:
    - The web server forwards the request to an **application server**, where dynamic content (like search results) is generated. The application server may run code to generate content dynamically.

7. **Database Access**:
    - The application server requests data from a **database** (if needed). This could involve querying Google’s vast index of websites or other data needed to generate a web page.

8. **Response**:
    - Once the data is collected, the **application server** sends the processed information back to the **web server**, which then returns the final web page content to the user’s browser. This content could be a Google search page or other related results.

## Diagram Description

A diagram illustrating the flow includes:

1. **DNS Resolution**: The browser sends a request to resolve the domain to an IP address.
2. **Firewall**: After resolving the IP, the request passes through a firewall.
3. **Encrypted Communication**: The connection is encrypted via TLS/SSL.
4. **Load Balancer**: The request is routed to a load balancer for distribution.
5. **Web Server**: The load balancer forwards the request to a web server on port 443.
6. **Application Server**: The web server communicates with an application server to generate the content.
7. **Database**: The application server queries the database for information.
8. **Response**: The generated web page is sent back to the web server, which delivers it to the user's browser.
